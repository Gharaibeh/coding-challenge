## Objective:
This coding challenge is designed to assess following software development skills:
-	Transform business problems to automated tests and develop solution (TDD)
-	Simple Design (Passing tests, reveals intent, DRY, small)

-	Ability to use AWS Services

## Problem
We have broken the problem into multiple steps to you a clear understanding.

### Step 01
Develop a function that takes one string input of N number of integers separated by single whitespace. The function then outputs the longest increasing subsequence (increase by any integer) present in that sequence. If more than 1 sequence exists with the longest length, output the earliest one. You may supporting functions as many as you find reasonable.

#### Sample Input 01
```
6 1 5 9 2
```
